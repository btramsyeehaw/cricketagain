This is a repository featuring ball by ball data of One Day Internationals taken from cricsheet.org, modified by hand to include fielding mistakes.

A list of all the series included can be found in the includedSeries.txt file.

You can help out by double checking the misfield data, using common sense, and websites which provide easily accessible ball by ball data such as espncricinfo.com, cricbuzz.com, or since 2022 icc-cricket.com
